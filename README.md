# Comprehensive-Report-on-SQL
A deeply documented SQL analysis and reporting project, showcasing advanced query logic, business-oriented insights, and complete report delivery all, 


Project Overview
- **Objective**: Perform end-to-end data analysis using raw SQL, from data exploration through advanced reporting, with clear business impact.
- **Scope**: 70-page written report including query walkthroughs, visual outputs (tables & charts), and business commentary.

##  Structure & Highlights

| Section          | Description |
| **Schema & Data** | Documentation of tables, relationships, and schema exploration using `information_schema` queries. |
| **Exploration**   | Count summaries, date range checks, value distributions, and initial insights via SQL. |
| **Advanced Queries** | Joins, CTEs, window functions, ranking, segmenting, and stored procedures. |
| **Business Insights** | Narrative-driven findings, e.g. high-value customers, trend analysis, inventory recommendations. |
| **Appendices**    | Full SQL scripts with comments, organized for clarity—data wrangling, analysis, reporting sections. |
| **Reflections**   | What I learned, challenges overcome, and techniques mastered. |

##  Tools & References
- **SQL Engine**: MySQL / PostgreSQL (specify)

##  How to Explore
1. Browse the `sql-report.pdf` / `.docx` for the full narrative.
